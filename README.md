Relibrerator
==========

This is a continuation of the fork for KindlePDFViewer librerator, a document viewer application, created for usage on the Kindle e-ink reader. It is currently restricted to 4bpp inverse grayscale displays. For PDF files it is using the muPDF library (see http://mupdf.com/), for DjVu files djvulibre library and for ebooks (fb2, mobi, ePub, etc) crengine. It can also read JPEG images using libjpeg library. The user interface is scripted using Lua (see http://www.lua.org/). For reflowing of PDF and DjVu files, it uses k2pdfopt library.

The application is licensed under the GPLv3 (see COPYING file).


Building
========


Follow these steps:

* automatically fetch thirdparty sources with Makefile:
	* make sure you have patch, wget, unzip, git and svn installed
	* run `make fetchthirdparty`.

* run `make thirdparty`. This will build MuPDF (plus the libraries it depends on), libDjvuLibre, CREngine and Lua.

* run `make`. This will build the kpdfview application


Running
=======

The user interface (or what's there yet) is scripted in Lua. See "reader.lua". It uses the Linux feature to run scripts by using a corresponding line at its start.

So you might just call that script. Note that the script and the kpdfview binary currently must be in the same directory.

You would then just call reader.lua, giving the document file path, or any directory path, as its first argument. Run reader.lua without arguments to see usage notes.  The reader.lua script can also show a file chooser: it will do this when you call it with a directory (instead of a file) as first argument.


Device emulation
================

The code also features a device emulation. You need SDL headers and library for this. It allows to develop on a standard PC and saves precious development time. It might also compose the most unfriendly desktop PDF reader, depending on your view.

If you are using Fedora Core Linux, do `yum install SDL SDL-devel`.
If you are using Ubuntu, do `apt-get install libsdl-dev1.2` package.

To build in "emulation mode", you need to run make like this:
	make clean cleanthirdparty
	EMULATE_READER=1 make thirdparty kpdfview

And run the emulator like this:
```
./reader.lua /PATH/TO/PDF.pdf
```

or:
```
./reader.lua /ANY/PATH
```

To keep things simple, put your pdf files in directory `test`, and run the emulator like this:
```
./reader.lua test
```

By default emulation will provide K3 resolution of 600*800. It can be specified at compile time, this is example for Kindle DX:

```
EMULATE_READER_W=824 EMULATE_READER_H=1200 EMULATE_READER=1 make thirdparty kpdfview
```

At this time, you can not have both arm and x86 compiled libraries on your computer. When compiling for the emulator after having compiled for the Kindle (and vice versa), be sure to run
```
make clean cleanthirdparty
```

You can compile and make launchpad installable package for Kindle using
```
make thirdparty kpdfview customupdate
```

Preferred toolchain for Kindle compiling is Code Sourcery/Mentor Graphics 2012.03-57.
